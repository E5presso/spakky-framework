"""Run tests with coverage for all packages in the workspace.

This script discovers all workspace members and runs pytest with coverage
for each package, generating XML reports for Codecov upload.

Usage:
    python scripts/run_coverage.py

Output:
    Generates coverage XML files in each package directory:
    - spakky/coverage.xml
    - plugins/spakky-fastapi/coverage.xml
    - etc.
